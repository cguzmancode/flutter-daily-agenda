# Daily Agenda - Flutter App

This Flutter app simulates a **Daily Agenda** screen as would be seen by a parent in an educational app.  
It demonstrates:

- Clean and responsive UI for mobile and desktop layouts
- State management with `flutter_bloc`
- Filtering events by selected child and category
- Loading child photos from a free API (mocked in tests)
- Well-structured and modular widget design
- Automated widget tests verifying UI rendering and user interactions

---

## Features

- Header with dropdown to select a child or all children
- Displays parent name (Luis LÃ³pez)
- Horizontal scrollable category selector (Feeding, Nap, Activities, Diapers, Notes)
- Shows event cards filtered by selected child and category
- Responsive layout adapting to screen width (mobile and wide/desktop)
- Mock data for children and events
- Widget tests included with mocked network images

- `lib/screens/` - Main screens (AgendaScreen and responsive layouts)
- `lib/widgets/` - Reusable widgets (EventCard, CategorySelector, etc.)
